Usages:
Language: Java, running at Language Level 8.
Java FX for UI.
Java was used since it can be used on windows, mac or linux. I know the language well since I have been using it for the past year.
It was fexible enough to complete this task in a short amount of time and proved to make a good solution of the problem at hand.


Assumptions:
No two hosts have the same ID, ID's will all be of type int, anything else will be rejected.
Will only be working with text files.
Text files will be formatted in the given format, else program will throw an error and tell you text file is not in a compatible format.
It will only throw errors for the lines that are not in the correct format,and continue to the next possible line it can accept.
As soon as any part of a line (Host) is corrupted/malformed the whole line is rejected (host is not created and addded to list).
States will only be M1, M2 or M3, however any other state will be accepted as long as the format remains the same and just the state name changes.
